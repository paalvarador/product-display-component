## Tech Stack used

For this project, I used the following tech stack:

- React.js (main requirement)
- Vite for create the react project
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Explanation

- I created a component called ProductDisplay that uses React and an interface to manage the component's props. I also have to say that the implementation of the toggle functionality was done using the hook useState to toggle between the product name and description.
- To style the component, I used Tailwind CSS.
- I have created a function called fetchProducts in the api.ts file to handle the functionality to fetch products using promises and fetch api.
